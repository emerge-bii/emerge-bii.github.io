<h2>A Comprehensive Toolkit for Interdisciplinary Team Science: From Authorship Frameworks to Field Safety Planning, Data Sharing to Mentor Training, this Workshop Shares Tools and Templates for Accomplishing Impactful Team Science Across Disciplines</h2>

***Description:***   This workshop will benefit early-, mid-, and late- career scientists interested in participating in, launching or leading multidisciplinary scientific teams.  Workshop participants will receive a toolkit of resources for accomplishing interdisciplinary team science.  The toolkit spans 6 areas: Governance & Infrastructure, Data Management, Team Science, Science Communication & Outreach, DEI & Mentorship, and Evaluation.  Team Science and Equity & Inclusivity are also explicitly built into many of the toolkit’s resources across all 6 areas. 


Guides, resources and templates across the toolkit areas will be introduced to participants as interconnected elements that can also be used independently. In small-group activities, participants will work through several key tools and challenges, including reconciling disciplines’ different authorship norms, and building inclusive team communication. Participants will develop a roadmap for applying relevant tools to their own projects, and depart ready to do so, with adaptable templates and strategies.  


Unlike tools imported into scientific settings from the business community, where differing culture and terminology can create a mismatch with users, this toolkit is built by scientists for scientists. These templates have been tested and refined with teams in a variety of cross-disciplinary contexts, from small teams within a single university to large institutes which cross universities and countries.


<span style="color: red">***Governance & Infrastructure***</span> tools include an Authorship Policy and Agreement, Mission Statement, ECR (early career researcher) Support Plan, and Governance Plan, and have an overarching emphasis on building resilient structures. 
 
<span style="color: orange">***Data Management***</span> tools include a Data Sharing Policy, Data Management Best Practices, and Common Repositories, and emphasize interdisciplinary integration. 


<span style="color: #FFC300">***Team Science***</span> tools include the development of Group Norms and Values, mapping differences in Team Communication (including conflict resolution, giving feedback, and repairing relationships), building Collaborative Thinking & Team Creativity, Roles & Responsibilities, Cultivating Genuine Relationships (and why they lead to better science), approaches to Inclusive Leadership, and practices for Running Effective Meetings. 


<span style="color: green">***Science Communication and Outreach***</span> tools focus on storytelling and navigating social media for scientists, as well as resources and venues for physical and virtual outreach. 


<span style="color: blue">***DEI & Mentorship***</span> tools include a Broadening Participation Plan template, a DEI-focused Field Safety Manual, and variants for both one-on-one and team mentoring systems, from the Mentoring Charter to Mentor and Mentee Action Plans,  a How-To Guide for Writing a Mentorship Philosophy, and Active Bystander training. 


<span style="color: purple">***Evaluation***</span> tools include social network analyses and their utility, and templates for externally-administered program assessment surveys. 


This toolkit has been developed in the NSF-funded EMERGE Biology Integration Institute,  by EMERGE’s scientists and science-of-team-science sociologists. with experience- and evidence-based improvements over EMERGE’s first three years.


**Learning Outcomes:**
* Familiarity with a multipurpose toolkit spanning 6  competency areas, and guidance on tailoring these tools to new-team needs  
* A deepened understanding of differing authorship norms across disciplines and how to navigate those differences in drafting authorship agreements  
* An group exploration of inclusive team practices, applying portions of the toolkit  


**Agenda:**  
1. Introduction to the Toolkit (Rich & Varner)
2. Overview of Governance & Infrastructure Tools (Rich, Varner, Bagby, & Burke)  
   a. Group Activity: Authorship differences by field, and Harmonizing them in Team Science. (Led by Cross & Rich, with ~8 breakout groups, each facilitated by an Organizer)
3. Overview of Team Science Tools (Cross & Mook)  
   a. Group Activity: Inclusive communication and leadership. (Led by Cross & Mook, with ~8 breakout groups, each facilitated by an Organizer)
4. Overview of Mentorship & DEI Tools (Varner)  
   a. Short case studies of how equity and inclusivity are woven through the Toolkit  (Burke)
5. Toolkit in Action (Bagby & Burke)
