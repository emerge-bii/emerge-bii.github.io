EMERGE-BII leverages the [IsoGenie Project](https://isogenie.osu.edu/), a 10-year Department of Energy-funded project at Stordalen Mire, to provide a solid foundation for ongoing investigation of long-term ecosystem-climate feedbacks at Stordalen Mire. Historical data from the IsoGenie Project, and new data from the EMERGE Project can be accessed via the <a href="https://emerge-db.asc.ohio-state.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**EMERGE Database**</a>.
