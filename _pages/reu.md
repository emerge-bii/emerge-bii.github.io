title: "Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program"

---

The EMERGE Institute seeks enthusiastic, motivated undergraduate or post-baccalaureate students to engage in multidisciplinary science on how ecosystems are responding to climate change. This paid summer research experience is team-driven, co-mentored by diverse EMERGE faculty, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and spans scales from microbes, to plants, to remote sensing. Students will develop projects in New Hampshire and travel to Arctic Sweden to conduct them, while gaining skills in networking, mentoring, and professional development, and will be financially and scientifically supported to present their research at a professional conference. Note that in order to participate and receive funding from the National Science Foundation, you must be a US citizen, US national, or permanent resident.

When: June 4th - August 5th, 2023

Location: The University of New Hampshire and Abisko, Sweden
