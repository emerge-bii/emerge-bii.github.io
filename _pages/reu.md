The EMERGE Institute is seeking enthusiastic and motivated undergraduate students who wish to participate in team-driven, co-mentored, integrative biology research projects that look to understand complex biological questions that span scales from microbes, to plants, to remote sensing. Work with EMERGE faculty, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to develop projects, travel to Northern Sweden to conduct field work, all while earning a summer stipend, gain skills in networking, mentoring, professional development, and present your research at professional conferences.
