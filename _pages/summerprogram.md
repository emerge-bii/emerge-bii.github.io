The NSF EMERGE Biology Integration Institute seeks post-baccalaureate scientists from any career stage - graduate student, postdoc, technician, faculty, and others - to train and engage in the multidisciplinary science of how ecosystems are responding to changes in the environment.

Attendees will learn & implement 4 core competencies of Interdisciplinary Ecosystem Science:

1. Foundational Science, spanning: biomolecules; isotopes; biotic and abiotic interactions; math in biology; representing biology in models; remote sensing; data management; gene regulation & acclimation; genetic diversity & adaptation; community assembly
2. Science of Team Science
3. Mentor Training
4. Science Communication

Attendees will meet in person for 1 week, virtually daily for a second week, and then meet as a cohort regularly over the following year to apply their trainings and collaboratively develop a paper.

This training, research, and professional development program is co-mentored by EMERGE faculty, and spans scientific scales from microbes, to plants, to remote sensing, and key team science skills including communication and mentoring.

Note that in order to participate and receive funding from the National Science Foundation, you must be a US citizen, US national, or permanent resident. (Interested non-residents/citizens with funding may be considered as space permits, and should apply indicating their self-funded status.)

When: Program dates TBD

Location: The University of New Hampshire and Zoom


**Previous Summer Program Experiences**

***Summer 2024***

We completed another successful year of our Summer Program in June in Durham, NH at the University of New Hampshire (week 1- in person, week 2-virtual). This year, we had 20 participants from various institutions and career stages including 2 assistant professors, 2 postdocs, 8 PhD students, 2 MS students, 4 research assistants, and 2 lab technicians. More than 26 EMERGE scientists were involved in teaching the course over two weeks.
